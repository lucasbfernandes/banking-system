# banking-system

FIXME: description

## Installation

First of all, you need the JVM and its associated tools, the JDK. In order to check if you already have it installed, run:

    $ which java

You should see:

    $ /usr/bin/javac

If not, you must install it. You can find more information regarding the installation [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). After you install it, you will need a Clojure build tool called [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). In order to have it installed, please type the following commands:

    $ mkdir -p ~/bin
    $ cd ~/bin
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
    $ chmod a+x lein

If you are a Windows user, their website will guide you through the installation process. After this, check if your installation was completed by typing the following command:

    $ lein -v

If you see an output, you are ready to go!
